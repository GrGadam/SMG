# Info
SimpleMaterialGenerators (SMG for short) is a Slimefun4 addon that helps aliviate some of the grind by providing simple generators that create simple materials.

## What it adds
Currently it adds generators for:<br>
Cobblestone - The basic generator<br>
Stone and Smooth stone - Smelted versions of the Cobblestone generator<br>
Gravel - Grinded version of the Cobblestone generator<br>
Sand - Crushed version of the Gravel generator<br>
Glass - Smelted version of the Sand generator<br>
Netherrack - 'Composted' version of the Stone generator<br>
Soul sand - 'Composted' version of the Sand generator<br>

## Using the generators
The generators by themselves will do nothing - at least not until they have a chest (directly) above them.<br>
(There's a multiblock example in the SMG category).<br>
Then they will start producing items.
The rate of their production is measured in Slimefun Ticks (indicated by the `t` in the items' lore.<br>
Note that they won't all work at the same rate.<br>
Generally the more process it takes to make one generator the more slow it will be.<br>
Some of them don't abide by that principle - currently being the Netherrack generator and the Soul sand generator.<br>
The reason for that is because they take more materials to craft a single of them<br>
instead of being a single Cobblestone generator through a processing chain.
